The solution involves ensuring that units within the `calc()` function are compatible. If mixing units, ensure proper conversion or use only one unit type throughout the calculation. Also double-check for any syntax errors, such as missing parentheses or operators.  For example, instead of `width: calc(50% + 10px);` which is valid, an invalid example would be `width: calc(50% + 10%);`, since the browser cannot add percentages and pixels directly. The correct way to add percentages and pixels would be to ensure both values are in the same unit or converting one to another.
