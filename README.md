This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error when using the CSS `calc()` function. The error arises from using incompatible units within the calculation, or from simple syntax errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and layout issues.  The `bug.css` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The bug is fairly difficult to spot, especially in more complex CSS files.
